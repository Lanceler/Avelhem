                interacted with. They still count toward to their owner’s unit
                limit. (Sovereigns can control up to 8 units at a time, and no
                more than 2 allied Scions may share the same class.)

                If scoring causes the Initiator to meet the victory requirement,
                they win the game. Otherwise, the game continues with their
                opponent becoming the Initiator.

                As noted earlier, the victory requirement is automatically set
                to 1, but players may increase it once someone wins.
